Relationship Between Students' Heights and Shoe Sizes

This Jupyter notebook explores the potential correlation between students' heights and their shoe sizes using Python. The notebook includes data collection, visualization, and statistical analysis to determine if there is a relationship between these two variables. By examining a dataset of students' heights and corresponding shoe sizes, the notebook aims to provide insights into whether there is a pattern that suggests a connection between these physical attributes.
